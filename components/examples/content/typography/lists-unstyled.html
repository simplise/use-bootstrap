<ul class="list-unstyled">
  <li>This is a list.</li>
  <li>It appears completely unstyled.</li>
  <li>Structurally, it's still a list.</li>
  <li>However, this style only applies to immediate child elements.</li>
  <li>Nested lists:
    <ul>
      <li>are unaffected by this style</li>
      <li>will still show a bullet</li>
      <li>and have appropriate left margin</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This may still come in handy in some situations.</li>
</ul>

  <b-div clearfix>
    <b-img
      src="https://dummyimage.com/377x210/868e96/ffffff&text=Responsive floated image"
      col="md-6"
      float="md-end"
      margin="b-3 s-md-3"
    />
    <b-p>
      A paragraph of placeholder text. We're using it here to show the use of
      the clearfix class. We're adding quite a few meaningless phrases here to
      demonstrate how the columns interact here with the floated image.
    </b-p>
    <b-p>
      As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image.
      Now imagine how this would look with some actual content in here, rather
      than just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on, but actually
      conveys no tangible information at. It simply takes up space and should
      not really be read.
    </b-p>
    <b-p>
      And yet, here you are, still persevering in reading this placeholder text,
      hoping for some more insights, or some hidden easter egg of content. A
      joke, perhaps. Unfortunately, there's none of that here.
